In this framework we have a simulation of real-time audio reading, processing and playing back

We are,	
* Reading an audio file
* Taking piece by piece this audio file (in literature or Internet it is called CHUNCK)
* Processing it using FIR and IIR Filters
* Playing it back
* Animating the amplitude plot using matplotlib.animation library

# Usage
python main.py
